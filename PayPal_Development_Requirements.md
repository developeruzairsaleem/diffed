# PayPal Development Requirements - What I Need From You

## Current Situation

- PayPal integration is 60% complete in the code
- I cannot create PayPal accounts (Pakistan restriction)
- Need your PayPal credentials to complete development and testing

## What I Need From You (Development & Testing)

### 1. PayPal Developer Account Access

**Action Required:** Create a PayPal Developer account and give me access

- Go to https://developer.paypal.com/
- Create developer account (free, no business verification needed)
- Create a new app
- **Share the login credentials with me** so I can access the developer dashboard

### 2. PayPal App Credentials

**Action Required:** Create a PayPal app and provide credentials

- **Client ID** (Public key)
- **Client Secret** (Private key)
- **App Name:** Diffed.gg (or whatever you prefer)

### 3. Test Environment Setup

**Action Required:** Set up sandbox environment for testing

- Enable sandbox mode in developer dashboard
- Create test buyer and seller accounts
- Provide test account credentials for payment testing

## What I Will Do With These Credentials

1. **Complete PayPal integration** in the checkout flow
2. **Test payment processing** end-to-end
3. **Fix any bugs** in the current implementation
4. **Ensure checkout works** before production deployment



## Next Steps

1. **Create PayPal Developer account**
2. **Create app and get credentials** 
3. **Share credentials along with developer account credentials with me** 
4. **I complete development**

---

**Bottom Line:** I need your PayPal Developer account access to complete the PayPal checkout integration. This is the only blocker preventing me from integrating paypal.
